# scutoid

This is a project that is primarily in meatspace, but requires some scripts to figure out 

every face of the scutoid share the home seed and another seed or plane.
every corner of the face shares two other constraints.
not every combination of constraints is a corner
Every edge of the scutoid had three constraints
these three constraints define a line and the end points of the edge are two corners.
these corners have a fourth extra constraint
there are many
