# polygonal scutoid

A scutoid is a shape that occurs in a layer of cells or epithemial. Usually these cells have a prisma shape, but when the layer of cells is curved sometimes.
I saw a few educational youtube video's on the subject, and there seemed to be different models published, but no model(s) seemd to be able to tile a surface 
and have similar shapes. The shape is a voronooi cell. See the included picture for more information.

Also included are shapes to make a little puzzle.
